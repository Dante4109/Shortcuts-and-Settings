    	Brackets:

    		Collapse all regions to only defintions aka methods:
    			Ctrl + m + ctrl + o




    		Sets all regions to the same collapsed or expanded state. If some regions are expanded and some collapsed, then the collapsed regions are expanded. Use this to view nested brackets when expanding a method:

    		ctrl + [: Open a block in a region.
    		ctrl + shift + [: Open all regions and blocks.

    Ideas:
    	move tab to other side

    	adjust two windows like in vs code using alt+a and alt+d
